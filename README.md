In order to build this cross-platform mobile e-commerce app, we will need a team of developers and designers with experience in frontend and backend development, as well as database management and server configuration. The app will be built using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile apps that can run on both Android and iOS devices.

The project will involve designing and developing a user-friendly and responsive frontend interface that meets the client's design requirements and brand identity. We will also need to configure the backend system, including the payment gateway, order management system, and inventory management system, to ensure the app can handle a large volume of transactions.

The team will consist of at least one frontend developer, one backend developer, one database administrator, and one project manager. The selling target will be determined by the client's business goals and objectives, and the payment method will be chosen based on the client's preferences and requirements.

Overall, our goal is to create a high-quality cross-platform mobile e-commerce app that provides a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for users and helps the client achieve their business goals.
